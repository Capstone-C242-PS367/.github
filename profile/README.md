## Bangkit Capstone-C242-PS367
The documentation of <b>Finku</b> application in Bangkit Capstone Project 2024

## About
Finku is an app for recapping income and outcome by mutation account or bank e-statement. To get started, users need to upload the mutation account or bank e-statement with image format, the system will recognize the transaction details, such as type (debt or credit), date, and amount. Before submitting the data, the user can validate the result and edit if necessary. After that user submits the form, the data will be stored to their account where users can view their monthly trends through interactive charts and summaries, with the option to send it to their email account.

The problem we aim to solve is the time-consuming and also the inconsistent of the manual financial tracking. By automating data extraction from bank mutation or e-statement using OCR, allowing users to efficiently monitor their financial activity without the need for any complex finance knowledge and constant manual input. We hope by building this app, we can help people to recap their financial activities and make better financial decisions while saving more times.
